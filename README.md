# 📘 AI Study Planner for Engineering Students

An AI-powered study planning system that intelligently allocates study time based on subject difficulty, confidence level, credits, and deadlines — helping engineering students study smarter, not harder.

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Engineering students face a high cognitive load while managing multiple technical subjects with varying prerequisites, deadlines, and difficulty levels.

Traditional planners are static and fail to adapt to:

- Weak vs strong subject areas
- Cognitive workload balancing
- Deadline pacing
- Study efficiency

This often leads to burnout, poor retention, and last-minute cramming.

---

## 🧠 Our AI Approach

This project implements an **explainable rule-based AI planner** that dynamically generates optimized study schedules by analyzing:

- Subject credits
- Confidence levels
- Weak/strong topic areas
- Available study hours
- Deadline timelines

The system simulates intelligent decision-making and provides actionable insights for students.
